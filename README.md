Challenge Statement: Torvald Klaveness

PROOF OF CONCEPT

Executive Summary:
The complexity of information exchange in the context of the Maritime industry is not an easy problem to solve. Data entry procedures provide loopholes for human errors to creep in. Also, ethics come into question especially when different stakeholders may benefit or detriment due to how ‘honest’ the data entry procedures are. Lastly, complex information may lead to inefficient interpretation and processing of the data, leading to inefficient practices.

Solution Name: DATA FLASK HUB

Our solution addresses each Desired Outcome as stated in the challenge statement. The prototype encompasses the following: a simple web interface, database containing noon report information, cloud service for data processing and machine learning.

Our Mission:
As computer science students, we seek to utilise technology to solve or at least mitigate the problems faced by the industry. The technology does not have to be complex or game changing, but rather simple solutions which can be understood and utilised by anyone.
